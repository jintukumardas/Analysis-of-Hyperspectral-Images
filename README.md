# Analysis-of-Hyperspectral-Images

# README

This repository contains the code for "Hyperspectral Image Analysis - Classification.ipynb", which focuses on the classification of hyperspectral images. The notebook provides various steps to preprocess the data, visualize the bands, perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Below is an overview of the contents and instructions to run the code.

# Instructions

Make sure you have the required libraries installed in your Python environment.
Run the notebook "Hyperspectral Image Analysis - Classification.ipynb" in a Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
The notebook contains code cells with explanations and results.
Follow the code cells sequentially to execute the code and observe the outputs.
The notebook includes sections for downloading the HSI data, reading the data, visualizing bands and ground truth, performing PCA, training the SVM classifier, and generating a classification map.
Modify the code or parameters as needed for your own analysis.
Please note that the notebook uses a specific dataset ("Indian_pines_corrected.mat" and "Indian_pines_gt.mat") for demonstration purposes. Ensure that the dataset is available in the same directory as the notebook or modify the code to provide the correct file paths.
